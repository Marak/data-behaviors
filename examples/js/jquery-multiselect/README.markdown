** This jQuery plugin is actively being converted to a jQuery UI widget.  Follow that development [here](http://github.com/ehynds/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget).  Both versions are (and will be) actively maintained and supported.  This jQuery plugin does NOT require jQuery UI dependencies, but is not nearly as robust as the widget version. **

This plugin progessively enhances an ordinary multiple select control into elegant drop down list of checkboxes, stylable with ThemeRoller.
