<h1>data-behaviors</h1>

data-behaviors is an unobstrusive open-source behaviors library built on top of jQuery and the jQuery UI and uses all the best jQuery plugins
data-behaviors utilizes HTML5s new <a href = "http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/>""data- attributes"</a>, while still maintaining backwards compatibility with IE6

data-behaviors was built from the ground up to help facilitate in the creation of quick, relatively rich, javascript user interfaces.

key goals :

- make the library and API as simple as possible. (see usage docs)
- fulfill the majority (we aim for 80%) of the needs of a rich UI out of the box, with no configuration while still allowing developers to customize the additional 20% with no artificial roadblocks or poorly thought out library architecture 
- eliminating the need to piece together various jQuery plugins for your project over and over again
- be so unobtrusive that no one on your dev team will have any excuse to not love the library!
